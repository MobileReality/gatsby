# Mobile Reality's Gatsby Fork

## Gatsby: Enhanced by Mobile Reality

Welcome to the Mobile Reality fork of Gatsby! Our decision to take on the responsibility of maintaining and improving this repository stems directly from the community feedback on GitHub. Concerns were raised about the pace of development and the future direction of Gatsby, which led us to step in and ensure its continued growth.

### üöÄ Why We're Here

As echoed by the community:

- On **November 17, 2023**, GitHub user **@biilmann** emphasized Gatsby's stability and its focus on enterprise-grade performance. While acknowledging that Gatsby might not be at the forefront of framework innovation, he reassured users that it would remain a robust choice for production-quality websites. The primary goals outlined were to maintain stability, integrate with new tools, and make Gatsby more open by decoupling it from proprietary infrastructure.

- However, on **May 10, 2024**, user **@gcko** highlighted concerns about the project's slow progress since late 2023. With the majority of recent commits being dependency updates or minor fixes, the community felt that Gatsby was being held in a "steady state" with limited innovation. This sentiment confirmed that the framework's future development required more active involvement.

In response to these messages, Mobile Reality decided to fork the Gatsby repository to ensure that it not only remains a stable and reliable framework but also continues to evolve with new features and performance enhancements. We are committed to contributing to the community and driving Gatsby forward.

### üéØ Our Goals

At Mobile Reality, we aim to contribute to the Gatsby ecosystem by focusing on:

- **Performance Enhancements:** Improving the speed and efficiency of Gatsby projects.
- **New Features:** Adding capabilities that help developers build more advanced web applications.
- **Community Support:** Contributing back to the community with plugins, tutorials, and documentation improvements.

### üí° Why Gatsby?

At Mobile Reality, we've built numerous marketing pages using Gatsby, and we've been extremely satisfied with its SEO and performance capabilities. Gatsby's static-site generation ensures that our sites load quickly and rank well on search engines, while its flexibility allows us to create dynamic user experiences. This success is why we are committed to continuing the development of Gatsby and enhancing its potential for both ourselves and the wider community.

Gatsby's ability to pull data from any source, including Markdown files, headless CMS systems like Contentful or WordPress, and REST/GraphQL APIs, makes it a versatile tool for web developers. Its combination of static-site generation and dynamic rendering options like DSG and SSR allows for fine-tuned control over performance and scalability.
